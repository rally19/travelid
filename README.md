            <li> 
                <strong>Role-Based Access Control</strong>
                <table border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
                    <tr>
                        <td align="center">
                            <font size="+2">
                                <b>&nbsp;NEW FEATURE&nbsp;</b>
                            </font>
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                <p>The secure middleware is enhanced with a granular role system, categorizing users into three distinct access levels: User, Staff, and Admin. This system ensures that authorization to sensitive data, payment proofs, and all administrator-exclusive pages is strictly enforced based on the user's assigned role, providing a layered defense against unauthorized access.</p>
